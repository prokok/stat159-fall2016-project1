#Conclusions  
***  
"Growth in a Time of Debt" by Reinhart and Rogoff at Harvard has been one of the most cited stats during the Great Recession and it impacted the government economic policy as well. It turns out that they selectively chose the data, used the inappropriate weighting system, and made coding errors in favor of their results. Guess how these mistakes are found. Graduate student, Thomas Herndon, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst tries to reproduce the result in this paper as a class assignment.  No matter how hard he tried, he was not able to retrieve the same result. Finally, he contacted the Reinhart and Rogoff, got the spreadsheet they worked on and figured out the errors they had made.   

Potti Scandal, which is the most notorious scandals in clinical medicine history, not only reveals the researcher might manipulate the data but also takes away lives of people. Data were fabricated and people desperately seeking for cure for tumor were easily deceived. Potti insisted that he was not aware that false or improper information had been included in the research.  

Both of cases put importance on the reproducibility in data analysis and research. What if other researchers or at statisticians pointed out that data were modified before commencing clinical trial?  Then those who passed away because of clinical medicine might live today. What if other professors looked over the paper before Rogoff and Reinhart published it? 	Then people would make better decision on economic policies. Reproducible and collaborative statistical data science is not a just statistical concept. It is a tool that convinces researchers properly use the data so that people can benefit from their findings.

- What were the easy part? 

The easiest part is explaining the relationship among computational tools and how they interact with each other. It was a process of explaining to these concepts to myself and the most insteresting part.

- What were the challenging part? 
   
The most challenging part is get used to markdown syntax. Everytime I wrote down the markdown syntax, the result did not appear as I expected. It was the most time consuming part but it helped me a lot to get used to markdown syntax.

- What things stuck with?    

Working on local directory using git was fun, but synchronizing my local directory to my github account was a little bit ambiguous to me. The problem was I had no idea how Github works behind the scenes. This projects helped me a lot to grasp the concpet of Github.

- What was the most consuming part?    

As I mentioned on the previous question, the markdown syntax was the most time consuming part because I needed some time to get used to it.

- Did I work with and/or get help from someone else?  

No. I workd on it by myself for the whole time. Maybe a little bit of help from professor.

- How much time did it take?  

It took approximately 8 hours to complete the essay and get the output as I wanted.
